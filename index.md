# Machine Learning Legal Guide

## Introduction 

The Machine Learning Legal Guide is a resource for data science teams to understand legal issues that come up in machine learning and data science projects. It's a work in progress; I anticipate the following organization: 

1. Introduction. 
2. Getting Your Data. 
3. Exploration and Analysis. 
4. Model Buiding. 
5. Model Deployment and Use. 

The goal is to organize the guide similar to the way data science teams organize their projects. Hopefully it will help you ask the right questions for your stage in the project. 

## Disclaimer 

I am a lawyer. I've worked at law firms and I've worked in-house at corporations. This project is my own and it does not represent any position taken by any client I currently represent or that I've represented in the past. 

I am not your lawyer. While I've tried to write something insightful and helpful, this is (optimistically) a scholarly writing exercise. I'm identifying themes and ideas. I'm summarizing and surmising for a general audience. I'm not analyzing your case and I'm not advising you on your particular case. Here is my one piece of legal advice: if you need legal advice, go talk to a lawyer.
