# Machine Learning Legal Guide

## Introduction 

The Machine Learning Legal Guide is a resource for data science teams to understand legal issues that come up in machine learning and data science projects. It's a work in progress; I anticipate the following organization: 

1. Introduction. 
2. Getting Your Data. 
3. Exploration and Analysis. 
4. Model Buiding. 
5. Model Deployment and Use. 

The goal is to organize the guide similar to the way data science teams organize their projects. Hopefully it will help you ask the right questions for your stage in the project.
